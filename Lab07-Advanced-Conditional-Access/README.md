# Lab 07 – Advanced Conditional Access Policies (Microsoft Entra)

## 🎯 Objective
In this lab, we configure **advanced Conditional Access policies** using the Microsoft Entra Admin Center to strengthen access control based on:
- Geographic location
- Risk level
- Session behavior

This lab builds upon the basics learned in **Lab 4: Conditional Access** by layering real-world policy scenarios.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft Entra Admin Center (`https://entra.microsoft.com`)
- Microsoft Entra ID E5 Trial
- Conditional Access Policies

---

## 🔐 Policies Created

### 1. **CA07 - Block Access from Outside US**
- **Users:** All users or test group
- **Cloud apps:** All cloud apps
- **Condition:** 
  - Network (formerly "Location"): Include *Any location*, Exclude *Named location: United States*
- **Access control:** Block access

---

### 2. **CA07 - Require MFA for High-Risk Sign-Ins**
- **Users:** All users or test group
- **Cloud apps:** All cloud apps
- **Condition:** 
  - Sign-in risk: High
- **Access control:** Require multi-factor authentication

---

### 3. **CA07 - Limit Session Persistence**
- **Users:** All users or test group
- **Cloud apps:** All cloud apps (⚠️ Required for session controls)
- **Session controls:**
  - Sign-in frequency: Every 4 hours
  - Persistent browser session: Never persistent

---

## 🧪 Outcomes
- Successfully enforced location-based access controls
- Applied risk-aware MFA requirements
- Reduced long-lived browser sessions for added security

## ✅ Next Step
You can now automate these policies using PowerShell and the Microsoft Graph SDK in **Lab 07 (Phase 2)**.

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2 – Automation (PowerShell + Microsoft Graph)

This phase recreates the three advanced Conditional Access policies using **Microsoft Graph PowerShell**.

### Files
- `Lab07_CA_Automation.ps1` – Creates (or skips, if already present) the three CA policies
- `Lab07_CA_Automation_Explanation.md` – What the script does, required permissions, and validation steps

### Prereqs
- Microsoft Graph SDK installed
- Role: Global Administrator or Conditional Access Administrator
- **Named Location** called `United States` (Countries/Regions)

### Connect to Graph
```powershell
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess","Directory.Read.All"
