# Lab 07 – Advanced Conditional Access Policies (Microsoft Entra)

## 🎯 Objective
In this lab, we configure **advanced Conditional Access policies** using the Microsoft Entra Admin Center to strengthen access control based on:
- Geographic location
- Risk level
- Session behavior

This lab builds upon the basics learned in **Lab 4: Conditional Access** by layering real-world policy scenarios.

### 2. **CA07 - Require MFA for High-Risk Sign-Ins**
- **Users:** All users or test group
- **Cloud apps:** All cloud apps
- **Condition:** 
  - Sign-in risk: High
- **Access control:** Require multi-factor authentication

---

### 3. **CA07 - Limit Session Persistence**
