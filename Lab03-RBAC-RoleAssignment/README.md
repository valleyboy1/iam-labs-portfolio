## 🎯 Objective

Assign and verify the **Azure AD Joined Device Local Administrator** role to a test user using both the **Microsoft Entra Portal** and **PowerShell (Microsoft Graph SDK)**.

---

## 🧠 Overview: What is RBAC?

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to assign permissions to users based on their job roles. In Entra ID, RBAC ensures least privilege access by assigning **directory roles** scoped to a tenant or specific resource.
