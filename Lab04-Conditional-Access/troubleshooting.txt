# Troubleshooting - Conditional Access Lab

## Issue:
Unable to create Conditional Access policies.

## Cause:
Microsoft Entra tenant has Security Defaults enabled by default.
Security Defaults enforce basic security for all users, which conflicts with custom Conditional Access policies.

## Solution:
1. Go to https://entra.microsoft.com
2. Navigate to: Microsoft Entra ID > Properties
3. Scroll to the bottom and click "Manage Security defaults"
4. Set "Enable Security defaults" to "No"
5. Click "Save"

This will allow custom Conditional Access policies to be created and enforced.
