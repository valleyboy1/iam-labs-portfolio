# Lab 4 – Conditional Access Policy (Microsoft Entra ID)

## 🎯 Objective
This lab demonstrates how to create a Conditional Access policy in Microsoft Entra ID to enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for a test user when accessing Microsoft 365 apps. This mirrors real-world scenarios where organizations use Conditional Access for Zero Trust enforcement.
