## ‚úÖ Lab Tasks Completed (Portal Only)

- Enabled Microsoft Entra PIM
- Assigned PIM eligibility for the **Security Administrator** role
- Configured activation settings:
  - Required MFA
  - Required justification
- Activated the eligible role as a test user
- Verified that the role was assigned and active

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Automation Status (PowerShell + Graph SDK)

Due to instability and function overflow issues with the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK (v2.x), automation for this lab is currently postponed.

The command `Get-MgDirectoryRoleDefinition` and related PIM cmdlets are not available or functional under current SDK constraints. A `.ps1` script is in progress using known role IDs instead.

‚úÖ Once stable, automation for eligibility assignment and activation will be included in this repo.

## üß† Key Concepts

- **Eligible** vs **Active** role assignment
- **Just-In-Time (JIT)** role access
- Using PIM to reduce standing access
