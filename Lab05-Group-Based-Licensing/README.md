> In this video, I walk through the steps of creating a security group, assigning a Microsoft 365 E5 license to that group, and confirming license inheritance by a member user. No PowerShell or screenshots were used—just straight portal work to get it done quickly and cleanly.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft Entra Admin Center (https://entra.microsoft.com)
- Microsoft 365 E5 Developer Tenant

## ✅ Outcome
Users added to the licensed group automatically receive the Microsoft 365 license assigned to the group. This ensures consistency and simplifies lifecycle management.
